								<p>Mars is an incredibly harsh environment: global-covering dust storms, toxic terrain, thin atmosphere, extremely low temperatures. To push the concept of human exploration and colonization of the Red Planet, much more research needs to be done on the adaptation of human physiology to such hard conditions. After 6 months of travel in microgravity condition, having dealt with the shock of a planetary reentry and landing, the first crew on Mars will face the challenge of recovery and rehabilitation, but also the need to assess and mitigate independently any possible health emergency throughout the mission. </p>
								<p>To enable these opportunities, we are organizing SMOPS (Space Medicine OPerationS), an analogue mission that will take place between November 21st and December 4th 2021 at the MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station), a research facility owned and managed by The Mars Society in the Moab desert, Utah, USA. For two weeks in isolation, our analogue astronauts will test different technologies and operational scenarios in the field of space medicine, in preparation for future human missions to Mars.</p>
								<p>The conditions offered by the MDRS are in many ways similar to the ones that can be found in a possible Mars habitat: desertic environment, crew isolation, spacesuit simulators for external activities, limited living spaces and resources (water and food), local energy (solar panels), and food production (greenhouse). This will allow analogue astronauts on Earth to simulate, as best as possible, the difficulties that human crews will face on the martian surface.</p>

The SMOPS crew will perform a <b>daily kinesiology exercise routine</b>, measuring its impact on their health and wellbeing and how they cope with stress. Moreover, they will perform several <b>cortisol tests</b>, playing an important role in understanding (but also preventing) potential health risks including high blood pressure, anxiety, high blood sugar, muscle weakness, etc..; the results of this experiment will be analyzed and published by one of the crew members who is a medical researcher at the University of Calgary, Canada.

In the frame of space suit and biomonitoring research, the SMOPS crew will test both the <b>BG space suit simulator prototype</b>, produced by Mars Planet, and a pair of <b>sensorised smart shoes</b>, engineered by Vibram and E-Novia group. Both experimental technologies will include several sensors able to measure the crew’s health conditions and the surrounding environment.
